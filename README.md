<h2>Abstract:</h2>

Chemical explosions in industrial facilities can cause severe harm to human safety, assets, and the environment. A widely used approach for estimating explosion impacts is the Trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalent method, which converts the energy of hazardous substances into an equivalent TNT energy value. This study develops an automated simulation for explosion impact assessment based on the TNT equivalent method using JavaScript. The model incorporates three empirical approaches—Crowl and Louvar, Alonso, and Sadovski—to estimate overpressure and consequence distances for three hazardous substances: Ammonium Nitrate (AN), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), and Hydrogen (H₂). Model validation was carried out using real accident data and technical literature, ensuring the reliability of the simulation results to support comprehensive risk assessments. The proposed tool can be applied for preliminary evaluations, emergency scenario planning, and as a technical reference in the design of explosion mitigation systems for process industries.
